  User Preferences:
- Mood: ${mood}  
- Watching with: ${watchingWith}  
- Preferred genre: ${genre}, ${actorGenre}
- Era: ${era}  
- Iconic movie song choice: ${movieSong} or similar  
- Age rating: ${ageRating}  
- Movie snack (for mood influence): ${snack}  

### Rules for Selection:  
1. Genre Matching: If the user picked a genre, recommend 4 exact matches and 4 complementary genres for variety.  
2. Group Watching: If "Friends" was selected, ensure diverse recommendations across multiple genres.  
3. Age Rating: Ensure all movies respect the chosen age rating (e.g., PG films must exclude R-rated movies).  
4. Era-Specific Recommendations: If a specific period was chosen (e.g., 'Classic' or 'Modern'), all recommendations must be from that time frame.  
5. Actor Influence: If an actor was chosen, prioritize movies featuring that actor in relevant genres.  
6. IMDb Rating Filter: Recommend only movies with a rating higher then 6.0 on IMDb.  
7. Avoid Repetitions: Ensure unique recommendations per quiz attempt and prevent duplicate results for the same IP address.  

### Output Format:  
 Return the result strictly in JSON format with exactly **8 movie titles**:  
 [{title:"title", year:"year"},{title:"title", year:"year"},{title:"title", year:"year"},{title:"title", year:"year"},
  {title:"title", year:"year"},{title:"title", year:"year"},{title:"title", year:"year"},{title:"title", year:"year"},]  
 Do not include any additional text or explanation.`;
